# OddTracker

An App to track projects and tasks, written in SwiftUI, for the purpose of demonstrating my skills and knowledge.

The READMEs in this project will be used for myself to take notes about the things I learn(ed) while I program(med) this app. To avoid a massive README I decided to just link Sub-READMEs:

## Sub-READMEs

[Basics](Sub-READMEs/Basics.md)

[Editing data](Sub-READMEs/EditingData.md)

[Filling out functionality](Sub-READMEs/FillingFunctionality.md)

[Cleaning Up](Sub-READMEs/CleanUp.md)

[Testing](Sub-READMEs/Testing.md)

[MVVM](Sub-READMEs/.MVVMmd)

[Integrating with the system](Sub-READMEs/SystemIntegration.md)

[Connecting to Apple](Sub-READMEs/ConnectingToApple.md)

[Cross-plattform](Sub-READMEs/CrossPlattform.md)

## Credits

A big thanks goes to [hacking with swift (HWS)](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/), espically the "Ultimate Portfolio App" course, where I learned most of the things I know about iOS development, as well as the awesome people in the HWS forums for always being helpful when I needed help with a confusing error message.
