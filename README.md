# OddTracker

An App to track projects and tasks, written in SwiftUI, for the purpose of demonstrating my skills and knowledge.

Instead of having multiple apps that each only cover a few topics (for portfolio purposes), this app aims to cover a huge range of topics: 

- Important frameworks: SwiftUI, Core Data and CloudKit
- System Integration: Widgets, App Clips and Spotlight
- Good programming practices: Testing, Architecture, Organization, Localization, Accessibility

Additionally this repo contains reasons for some of the choices made as well as the solutions to some of the problems faced while programming this app. To avoid a massive README I decided to divide and conquer (creating and linking Sub-READMEs)

**Important note**: the READMEs are written based on where the project was at that point in time, so when I write about a class and its methods, I'm only mentioning what was already there at that point in time, additions and changes to the class will be in later READMEs.

## Credits

A big thanks goes to [hacking with swift (HWS)](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/), espically the "Ultimate Portfolio App" course, where I learned most of the things I know about iOS development, as well as the awesome people in the HWS forums for always being helpful when I needed help with a confusing error message.
